# Story

I started programming with a very strong enthusiasm for ideas and dreams. I've always had a lot of ideas, creativity and a head for the box, my first wave of action-packed, open-world enthusiasm. This dream made me know RPG Maker, the program for building rpg that got me started in the programming world (it had an event-oriented internal language). Over time, projects can be increasingly added to this world of technology, the most notorious being a portal for jokes, videos and flash games called anima10. In a second phase, like game ideas, I'm focused on data, hacking, and cyber attacks, which form an access code in all forms and a prerequisite with new languages ​​and computer systems.
